			<p id="tribute-info">Once known as a legendary hunter during the Maverick Wars, Zero was reawakened by Ciel to assist the resistance during the energy crisis. During this time, Zero would act time and time again to save as many lives as he could, both human and reploid. He was among the few individuals who advised Elpizo against attempting a full scale attack on Neo Arcadia. Zero eventually gave his life to stop the Ragnarok from crashing into the planet. He ultimately perished upon defeating Dr. Weil, but his actions saved countless others.</p>
